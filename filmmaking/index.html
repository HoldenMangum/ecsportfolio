	  <h2>My Wholelife I've wanted to be a filmmaker. It all started with my grandparents who would show me all the "cool" movies when i was little. Over time I saw more and more films
	  and grew facinated how movies where made, and how they were accomplished. When i turned about 10 we visted a "Films of Stanley Kubrick Meusuem" in Barcelona.
	  I then grew facinated with filmmakers and how they accomplish there work.</h2>

	  <h1>Spotlight: Martin Scorsese/ Quentin Tarentino</h1>
	  <h3>These two guys have impacted how I make my own films more then anything. Goodfellas and Pulp fiction are such masterworks for me that you can see
	  there fimmaking styles all over my own work.  I also love there deeper cut work aswell, for scorsese stuff like After hours, Color of money, The Irishman
	  etc. and IM STILL WAITING ON THAT LAST MOVIE TARENTINO (but Once upon a time...in Hollywood is simply one of the best films of all time so wait 
	  as long as youd like.</h3>
